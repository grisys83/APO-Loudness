# ApoLoudness User Manual v0.3.3

## üéµ What is ApoLoudness?

**"An innovative audio tool that maintains tonal balance regardless of volume changes"**

ApoLoudness is a program that maintains the same tonal balance as 80dB even at low volumes. This allows you to enjoy rich bass and natural timbre while protecting your hearing.

## üî¨ How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Human ears have different frequency sensitivities depending on volume. At quiet levels, bass and treble are relatively harder to hear. ApoLoudness precisely corrects this based on equal-loudness contours.

- **Traditional volume control**: All frequencies ‚Üë‚Üì equally ‚Üí Tonal balance changes
- **ApoLoudness**: Custom adjustment per frequency ‚ÜïÔ∏è ‚Üí Tonal balance maintained ‚ú®

## üì• Download and Installation

### Download Links

- **Windows Installer**: [ApoLoudness_v0.3.3_Setup.exe](https://github.com/grisys83/APO-Loudness/releases/download/v0.3.3/ApoLoudness_v0.3.3_Setup.exe)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Legal Notice

- By installing this software, you agree to the GPLv3 license
- All usage responsibility lies with the user
- The installer requires Administrator privileges

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Install ApoLoudness
1. Download and run `ApoLoudness_v0.3.3_Setup.exe`
2. The installer will detect your audio device's sample rate
3. Confirm or change the sample rate (44.1kHz or 48.0kHz)
4. Installation path: `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\ApoLoudness\`

#### Step 2: Verify Installation
The installer automatically:
- Copies program files to EqualizerAPO config folder
- Installs appropriate filter files (44.1kHz or 48.0kHz)
- Updates EqualizerAPO's config.txt with `Include: ApoLoudness\ApoLoudness.txt`
- Creates shortcuts in Start Menu and Desktop (optional)

#### Step 3: First Run
1. Launch ApoLoudness from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
2. Launch ApoLoudnessCalibration for initial setup
3. Follow the calibration process below

## üéØ Calibration (Required Once)

### Required Equipment

- Smartphone (with SPL meter app installed)
- Headphones or speakers
- Quiet environment (minimize background noise)

### Recommended SPL Meter Apps

- **iOS**: NIOSH Sound Level Meter
- **Android**: Decibel X (dBA, dBC)
- **Measurement mode**: Z-weighting recommended (C-weighting is OK if unavailable)

### Calibration Process

#### Understanding Calibration

ApoLoudness now uses advanced (Reference, Target) pair calibration for more accurate Real SPL estimation. However, you don't need to measure all 21 combinations - the system can intelligently interpolate missing values.

#### Step 1: Launch Programs

1. Run `ApoLoudnessCalibration.exe`
2. Run `ApoLoudness.exe`
3. In ApoLoudness, right-click ‚Üí Check "Calibration Mode"

#### Step 2: Set Reference Point (80dB)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Very Important Preparation**:
- Windows volume: Set to 100%
- Amp volume: Set slightly lower than usual
- 0dB pink noise will be played!

1. Place phone microphone inside headphone ear cup
2. Click "Pink Noise" play button in Calibration program
3. Adjust amp volume until SPL meter shows exactly 80dB
4. Enter 80 in "Measured SPL" and click Next

#### Step 3: Measurement Process

**Simplified Approach (Recommended for most users):**
- Measure Reference 80 with Targets: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80
- This covers the most common usage scenarios
- Other combinations will be intelligently estimated

**Comprehensive Approach (For advanced users):**
The system supports measuring all combinations:
- **Reference 90:** Targets 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90
- **Reference 80:** Targets 40, 50, 60, 70, 80  
- **Reference 70:** Targets 40, 50, 60, 70
- **Reference 60:** Targets 40, 50, 60
- **Reference 50:** Targets 40, 50
- **Reference 40:** Target 40

Process:
1. In Calibration Mode, preamp uses exact map values (no offset)
2. Use Alt + Wheel to set Reference level
3. Use Wheel to adjust Target in 10dB steps
4. Click "Play Test Tone" and measure SPL
5. Enter reading and click Next
6. The system saves as (Reference, Target) pairs for accurate lookup

#### Step 4: Save

- After all measurements complete, click "Save Calibration"
- If failed, restart programs and try again

### üí° Calibration Tips

- If "Play Test Tone" is disabled, press Stop button to re-enable
- If measurements seem off, check background noise or microphone position
- Recommend measuring multiple times for consistent values

## üöÄ How to Use

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Controls (Complete Guide)

### Auto Offset Mode (Recommended)

After calibration is complete, turning on Auto Offset lets you experience the true value of ApoLoudness.

**Auto Offset Features**:
- Real SPL based volume control
- Automatic tonal balance optimization
- Smart Target/Reference adjustment:
  - Wheel up normally: Increases Target up to Reference
  - Wheel up "a lot" (10+ times): Increases both Target and Reference by 1
  - Wheel down: Decreases Target, and Reference follows when Target < 80

**How to Use**:
1. Right-click ‚Üí Check "Auto Offset" OR use Right Mouse + Wheel anywhere
2. Adjust volume with scroll wheel for Real SPL based control
3. Double-click to reset to defaults

### Manual Mode (Advanced Users)
