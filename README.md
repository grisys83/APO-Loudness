# ApoLoudness User Manual v0.3.1

## üéµ What is ApoLoudness?

**"An innovative audio tool that maintains tonal balance regardless of volume changes"**

ApoLoudness is a program that maintains the same tonal balance as 80dB even at low volumes. This allows you to enjoy rich bass and natural timbre while protecting your hearing.

## üî¨ How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Human ears have different frequency sensitivities depending on volume. At quiet levels, bass and treble are relatively harder to hear. ApoLoudness precisely corrects this based on equal-loudness contours.

- **Traditional volume control**: All frequencies ‚Üë‚Üì equally ‚Üí Tonal balance changes
- **ApoLoudness**: Custom adjustment per frequency ‚ÜïÔ∏è ‚Üí Tonal balance maintained ‚ú®

## üéØ Calibration (Required Once)

### Required Equipment

- Smartphone (with SPL meter app installed)
- Headphones or speakers
- Quiet environment (minimize background noise)

### Recommended SPL Meter Apps

- **iOS**: NIOSH Sound Level Meter
- **Android**: Decibel X (dBA, dBC)
- **Measurement mode**: Z-weighting recommended (C-weighting is OK if unavailable)

### Calibration Process

#### Step 1: Launch Programs

1. Run `ApoLoudnessCalibration.exe`
2. Run `ApoLoudness.exe`
3. In ApoLoudness, right-click ‚Üí Check "Calibration Mode"

#### Step 2: Set Reference Point (80dB)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Very Important Preparation**:
- Windows volume: Set to 100%
- Amp volume: Set slightly lower than usual
- 0dB pink noise will be played!

1. Place phone microphone inside headphone ear cup
2. Click "Pink Noise" play button in Calibration program
3. Adjust amp volume until SPL meter shows exactly 80dB
4. Enter 80 in "Measured SPL" and click Next

#### Step 3: Step-by-Step Measurement (70dB ‚Üí 60dB ‚Üí 50dB ‚Üí 40dB)

1. In ApoLoudness window, scroll mouse wheel to set Target to 70
2. Click "Play Test Tone" in Calibration
3. Enter SPL meter reading in "Measured SPL"
4. Click Next
5. Repeat for 60dB, 50dB, 40dB

#### Step 4: Save

- After all measurements complete, click "Save Calibration"
- If failed, restart programs and try again

### üí° Calibration Tips

- If "Play Test Tone" is disabled, press Stop button to re-enable
- If measurements seem off, check background noise or microphone position
- Recommend measuring multiple times for consistent values

## üöÄ How to Use

### Auto Offset Mode (Recommended)

After calibration is complete, turning on Auto Offset lets you experience the true value of ApoLoudness.

**Auto Offset Features**:
- Target and Real automatically linked
- Optimal Offset automatically calculated when scrolling
- Perfect tonal balance maintained

**How to Use**:
1. ApoLoudness right-click ‚Üí Check "Auto Offset"
2. Hover mouse over program window ‚Üí Adjust volume with scroll wheel
3. Double-click: Restore defaults (Target 60, Real 60 SPL)

### Manual Mode (Advanced Users)

Use when you want fine manual adjustments with Auto Offset off.

**Controls**:
- **Scroll wheel**: Adjust Offset (like normal volume)
- **Ctrl + wheel**: Adjust Target (maintain bass while adjusting volume)
- **Alt + wheel**: Adjust Reference (advanced setting)

## üéõÔ∏è Interface Description

### Main Screen
```
Target: 60.0  Reference: 80.0  Offset: +1.0
Preamp: -15.6 dB  Real: 60.3 dB SPL
```

**Parameter Meanings**:
- **Target**: Desired volume level (40-80dB)
- **Reference**: Reference volume level (typically fixed at 80dB)
- **Offset**: User fine-tuning value (-20dB to +10dB)
- **Preamp**: Final gain applied to Equalizer APO
- **Real**: Actual measured sound pressure level (based on calibration)

### Context Menu (Right-click)

- **Always on Top**: Keep window on top
- **Auto Offset**: Automatic optimization mode
- **Calibration Mode**: Calibration mode
- **Info**: Current settings and help
- **Exit**: Exit program

## üîß Troubleshooting (FAQ)

**Q1: When Real value differs significantly from Target**
A: Re-perform calibration or adjust Offset in Manual mode.

**Q2: When sound is too quiet or loud**
A:
- Adjust with scroll wheel in Auto Offset mode
- Adjust Offset value in Manual mode
- Check amp or system volume

**Q3: When tonal balance seems off**
A:
- Ensure Target doesn't exceed Reference (Target ‚â§ Reference)
- Re-check calibration measurements
- Double-click to restore defaults and retry

**Q4: When program doesn't work**
A:
- Check if Equalizer APO is properly installed
- Verify "Include: Loudness.txt" setting
- Restart "AudioEndpointBuilder" in Windows services

**Q5: Errors during calibration**
A:
- Background noise too high: Measure in quieter environment
- Inconsistent measurements: Fix microphone position and distance
- Measurements too high or low: Re-adjust amp volume

## ‚ö° Advanced Tips

### Recommendations for Optimal Use

**Environment Setup**:
- Perform calibration in quiet environment
- Maintain consistent listening environment (chair position, headphone wearing, etc.)
- High-quality headphones/speakers recommended

**Improving Measurement Accuracy**:
- Use average of multiple measurements during calibration
- Fine-tune while actually using at various Target levels
- Measure at consistent times as results may vary by time of day

**Real-World Optimization**:
- Actively use Auto Offset mode
- Identify preferred Target levels by music genre
- Avoid prolonged use above 80dB to protect hearing

### Various Usage Scenarios

#### üí§ Night Listening (Quiet Environment)
- Target: 40-50dB
- Auto Offset: ON
- Maintain rich tone without disturbing neighbors

#### üéµ General Music Listening
